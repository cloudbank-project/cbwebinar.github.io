# cbwebinar.invitation


> Cloudbank is an NSF initiative to lower barrier-to-entry for researchers to use commercial cloud for data science. The CloudBank partnership is UC San Diego, UC Berkeley and the University of Washington. Periodically we host a short (20-minute) intro webinar to describe the program and the resources we provide; including proposal support, cost estimation, cost savings, training/learning, curriculum applications, solutions for common cloud computing tasks and much more. Our next webinar is not scheduled at this time. (3/30/2021)
